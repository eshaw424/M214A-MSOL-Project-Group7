We recomend running code locally using the Jupyter Notebook extension for VSCode.
We are using the full feature open smile library which can take a while to run.
In our experience running locally drastically speeds up training times.

To run our code, simply change the project_data_file_path variable to point to your local directory where the training data is stored.
    - This should work with any training data as long it has the same internal file structure of the original project data given for testing.

Once your directory is properly set all the code blocks should be able to run sequentially while installing and importing dependencies when necessary.
    - If for some reason an error is thrown due to a missing dependency, either run 'pip install NAME_OF_DEPENDENCY' in your local terminal; or add 
      '!pip install NAME_OF_DEPENDENCY' to one of the proceeding code blocks, where NAME_OF_DEPENDENCY is swaped with the name of the library that 
      is missing in either case

In our experience with the given training data, the model takes around 2 hours to fully train on our local machines
